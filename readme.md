# Django Marketplace
## Online shopping app

### Description
This is a Marketplace webapp I made using Django, as an exercise in creating more complex projects to showcase my
skills.

### Features
The Marketplace app is designed to resemble a classic e-commerce website.
Main features include:

**User Creation and Authentication**: After creation through a sign-up page, each user can access an admin page to create
products they want to sell, which will be displayed on the main page.

**Product Creation**: New items can be added to the Marketplace by users through the New Item form.

**User Dashboard**: Each user can access their dashboard and see all the items they have created. Through this dashboard,
items can be added, edited, or deleted.

**Browse Items**: All the items in the Marketplace can be browsed through the Browse function. Browse also has search
functionality, which can also be used in combination with filters to narrow the item category when searching.

### Technology
Main technology used is **Django** 5.0.6. Using Django I set up the entire project and the backend functionality.

To create the frontend, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind**. For storing the user and product information I used
the default Django database, which is **SQLite3**.
