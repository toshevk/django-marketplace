# Django Marketplace
## Online shopping app

### Description
This is a Marketplace webapp I made using Django, as an exercise in creating more complex projects to showcase my
skills.

### Features
The Marketplace app is designed to resemble a classic e-commerce website.
Main features include:

**User creation and authentication**: After creation through a sign-up page, each user can access an admin page to create
products they want to sell, which will be displayed on the main page.

**Product creation and editing**: Products can be managed through the **item dashboard**. Products' attributes include
category, title, description, image, and price.

### Technology
Main technology used is **Django** 5.0.6. Using Django I set up the entire project and the backend functionality.

To create the frontend, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind**. For storing the user and product information I used
the default Django database, which is **SQLite3**.
